# Job-Application-Tracker
This program will help with the job search by allowing you to store all of your job applications in one place.
Simply run 'JobApplicationTracker.py' to use the program.
The data is stored in the 'JobAppData.txt' file. 'JobApplicationTracker.py' must have access to this file to work.

This has been tested, so it should be relatively bug free, but if you find something wrong, please let me know!
